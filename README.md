# README

This repository contains QT C++ / C++ code for an Android P300 speller application called "MindEdit". The application is a simple text editor that uses EEG recording. The code includes implementation of machine learning methods used for the classification of P300 patterns in the EEG signals. The interface of the application is shown in the following figure.
